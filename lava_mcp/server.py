_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) is a system for automated testing on
real hardware: it schedules jobs onto physical devices ("boards") in a lab, deploys
or flashes an OS image, boots it, and runs tests — all described by a YAML job
definition. Boards are grouped by device-type; a job queues until a matching board is
free. Results and logs are retrievable per job.

This server proxies one LAVA instance: query devices/jobs, submit and manage test
jobs, and open interactive sessions to a board. General LAVA tools grant exactly what
your own LAVA token grants.

There are TWO different ways to get an interactive shell/console, for different jobs:

1. Board session — a shell in a container running *next to* the board (on the
   worker), NOT a shell on the board itself. Use it for host-side work against the
   device: flashing, fastboot/adb, qdl, and bring-up. It needs the board's USB
   exposed to the container. Reach for it when you need to control *how* the board is
   driven from the host rather than the fixed deploy LAVA would run — e.g. trying
   different flashing software or versions, custom fastboot/qdl/adb sequences, or
   deeper hands-on debugging over USB (a board that won't boot, recovery mode).
   Tools: open_board_session -> run_in_session (run one command) or attach_shell
   (interactive ssh). Only devices tagged for remote access can host one.

   The container is Debian and runs as root, so you can apt-get or build any tooling
   at runtime. E.g. build qdl from source and detect the attached board (in EDL mode
   it enumerates as Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 05c6:9008):
     apt-get update && apt-get install -y git build-essential pkg-config \\
       libusb-1.0-0-dev libxml2-dev
     git clone https://github.com/linux-msm/qdl && make -C qdl
     lsusb | grep -i '05c6:9008'   # board present in EDL mode; qdl can now flash it

2. Serial console — the board's *own* serial console (UART): boot/kernel logs, the
   login prompt, a shell on the booted board. Use it when you need what's actually on
   the board, or console access with no DUT networking. Reach for it to interact with
   the booted board directly — drive tests and run commands live at the console
   WITHOUT writing a LAVA test definition, watch the boot, or work with the
   bootloader/login prompt. Unlike a board session, this path uses LAVA to DEPLOY and
   BOOT an image first; the server then adds a test action that bridges the console
   out. Tools: check_serial_console_support -> open_console_session -> attach_console.

   Writing a correct deploy+boot LAVA job from scratch is hard. Do NOT hand-author
   the boot flow — adapt an existing job. ALWAYS base it on a previous successful job
   whose deploy `url` closely matches the artifacts you want to boot: deploy+boot
   parameters (flash method, rawprogram/patch, storage, auth headers) are
   image-specific, so ONLY a job that flashed a similar URL is a safe template. Use
   list_jobs to find candidates for this device and get_job_definition to compare
   their deploy `url`; pick the closest URL match. Do NOT use an unrelated job (e.g. a
   health-check, or a job for a different image) as the template — it will have
   incompatible deploy settings. Keep the matching job's deploy+boot actions — swap in
   your URL but KEEP its artifact authentication (HTTP headers such as Authorization,
   and any token/credentials) so the fetch succeeds — and add the console proxy on
   top. You do NOT need an example anywhere:
   open_console_session returns (in its `add_to_job` field) the exact `services` test
   action to paste in as the first action, plus the `environment:` values to set.
   After submitting, poll check_console_ready(job_id) until ready:true (instead of
   reading logs), then call attach_console.

Handing out an SSH key (attach_shell/attach_console): the returned private_key must
be saved to a file with `chmod 600` — ssh refuses a key file with looser permissions.

            You do NOT need to find an example in any repo: this call returns, in
            ``add_to_job``, the exact ``services`` test action to paste in and the full
